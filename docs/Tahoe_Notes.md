# macOS Tahoe Notes

On June 9th 2025, macOS unveiled macOS 26, aka macOS Tahoe. Seemingly, Apple decided to drop the version-based naming scheme (macOS 16 would have been the next logical version) to a year-based scheme (26 as in 2026)… I am already not a fan. Apple also announced that "macOS Tahoe will be the final release for Intel Macs".

## (Officially) Supported Mac Models

## Supported Intel Mac Models

- **Noetbooks**: Coffee Lake or newer 
- **Desktops**: Coment Lake only (iMac20,1/iMac20,2)
- The rest (MacPro, iMacPro, Mac mini, MacBookAir): dropped

It looks like Dortania has a lot of work to do to include all of these newly dropped Intel Macs into OCLP…

## New features

- Nothing really noteable besided an overhaul of Spotlight

## OpenCore Patcher Support

- Unknown yet. Waiting for official statements by Dortania et. al.

## Status

- Don't install macOS Tahoe yet! Wait for updated kexts and OpenCore builds.
