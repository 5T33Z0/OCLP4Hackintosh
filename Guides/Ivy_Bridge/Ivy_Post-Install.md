# Installing macOS Ventura and newer on Ivy Bridge systems

## Post-Install
OpenCore Legacy patcher can re-install components which were removed from macOS, such as Graphics Drivers, Frameworks, etc. This is called "root patching". For Wintel systems, we will make use of it to install iGPU and GPU drivers primarily.

### Installing Intel HD4000 Drivers
Once you reach the set-up assistant (where you select your language, time zone, etc), you will notice that the system feels super sluggish – that's normal because it is running in VESA mode without graphics acceleration, since the friendly guys at Apple removed the Intel HD 4000 drivers. 

To bring them back, do the following:

- Run the OpenCore Patcher App 
- In the OpenCore Legacy Patcher menu, select "Post Install Root Patch":</br>![Post_Root_Patches](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/15fe5dc1-793c-465c-9252-1ee6e503c680)
- Next, click on "Start Root Patching":</br>![startpatch](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/a3e96078-6a66-4db4-99a5-5edf31c9fc8f)
- The App has to relaunch with Admin Roots. Click Yes:</br>![reeeelaunch](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/25df894b-f943-4720-83ab-04c35c685043)
- You will have to enter your Admin Password and then the installation will begin:</br>![Install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181920398-38ddf7c5-0dfd-428e-9d7a-5646010d3c08.png)
- Once. it's done, you have to reboot and Graphics acceleration will work
- Continue with the Post-Install process as described in the Repo.

### Installing Drivers for other GPUs
- Works basically the same way as installing iGPU drivers
- OCLP detects the GPU and if it has drivers for it, they can be installed. Afterwards, GPU Hardware Acceleration should work. Note that additional settings in OCLP may be required based on the GPU you are using.
- After the drivers have been installed, disable the following `boot-args` prior to rebooting to re-enable GPU graphics acceleration:
  - `-radvesa` – put a `#` in front to disable it: `#-radvesa`
  - `nv_disable=1` – put a `#` in front to disable it: `#nv_disable=1`

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Prior to installing macOS updates you probably have to re-enable boot-args for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs again to put them into VESA mode so you have a picture and not a black screen!

### Verifying SMC CPU Power Management
To verify that SMC CPU Power Management is working, enter the following command in Terminal:

```shell
sysctl machdep.xcpm.mode
```
If the output is `0`, the legacy `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` is used for CPU Power Management and everything is ok. If the output is `1`, the `X86PlatformPlugin` for `XCPM` is used, which is not good since XCPM doesn't work well on Ivy Bridge CPUs in macOS. In this case, check if the necessary kexts for SMC CPU Power Management were injected by OpenCore. Enter in Terminal:

```shell
kextstat | grep com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement
```
This should result in the following output:

```
com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement (222.0.0)
com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagementClient (222.0.0) 
```
If the 2 kexts are not present, they were not injected. So check your config and EFI folder again. Also ensure that the `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` Quirk is enabled.

#### Optimizing CPU Power Management
Once you've verified that SMC CPU Power Management (plugin-type `0`) is working, monitor the behavior of the CPU using [Intel Power Gadget](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/1056-intel-power-gadget/). If it doesn't reach its maximum turbo frequency or if the base frequency is too high/low or if the idle frequency is too high, [generate an `SSDT-PM`](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/Content/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/CPU_Power_Management/CPU_Power_Management_(Legacy)) to optimize CPU Power Management.

### Removing/Disabling boot-args
After macOS Ventura is installed and OCLP's root patches have been applied in Post-Install, remove or disable the following boot-args:

- `ipc_control_port_options=0`: ONLY when using a dedicated GPU. You still need it when using the Intel HD 4000 so Firefox and electron-based apps will work.
- `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1`: ONLY needed for re-applying root patches with OCLP after System Updates
- Change `-radvesa` to `#-radvesa` &rarr; This disables the boot-arg which in return re-enables hardware acceleration on AMD GPUs.
- Change `nv_disable=1` to `#nv_disable=1` &rarr; This disables the boot-arg which in return re-enables hardware acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Keep a backup of your currently working EFI folder on a FAT32 USB flash drive just in case your system won't boot after removing/disabling these boot-args!

### Verifying AMFI is enabled
We can check whether or not AMFI is enabled by entering the following command in Terminal:

```shell
sudo /usr/sbin/nvram -p | /usr/bin/grep -c "amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"
```

- The desired output is `0`: this means, the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1` boot-arg which disables AMFI is not present in NVRAM which indicates that AMFI is enabled. This is good.
- If the output is `1`: this means, the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1` boot-arg which disables AMFI is present in NVRAM which indicates that AMFI is disabled. 

Since the new `AMFIPass.kext` allows booting macOS with applied root patches and SIP as well as SecureBootModel disabled but AMFI enabled, we want the output to be `0`!

## OCLP and System Updates

### Re-applying root patches after System Updates
The major advantage of using OCLP over other Patchers is that it remains on the system even after installing System Updates. After an update, it detects that the graphics drivers are missing and asks you, if you want to to patch them in again, as shown in ths example:

![Notify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181934588-82703d56-1ffc-471c-ba26-e3f59bb8dec6.png)

You just click on "Okay" and the drivers will be re-installed. After the obligatory reboot, everything will be back to normal.

### OCLP App Update Notifications

OCLP can also inform you about availabled updates of the Patcher app itself. But this requires adding the key `OCLP-Version`to the `NVRAM/Add` section of your config.plist:

![OCLPver01](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/4a7b0fc8-2ab5-4d2c-9ab2-ea62ca7614ff)

This ke is optional for Hackintosh users, since the OCLP app also informs you about updates once you run it. If you choose to add it to your config, you also have to add a reset key to the corresponding `NVRAM/Delete` section, so that new values can be applied:

![OCLPver03](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/2ca84e3b-fb66-4d96-8fe8-d8ee94fde0a5)

After that, you will be notified whenever an update for the OpenCore Patcher is available:

![OCLPver02](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/dc61fb53-2a72-4523-81fe-a0df3596bc73)

Note that this Pop-up refers to "OpenCore" and not the Patcher because OCLP was designed with real Macs and Mac users in mind. For "regular" Mac users, using OCLP is most likely the only way they update OpenCore, config and kexts. So after downloading the latest OCLP update, they, just rebuild the EFI, mount the ESP, replaces the EFI/OC folder, apply reoo patches, reboot and that's it. 

But as Hackintosh users, we only care about the App updates to apply new, updated or refined root patches for iGPUs, Wi-FI, etc. Please keep in mind that you have to manually adjust the OCLP version number after each update so that you won't be notified about a possibly outdated patcher app although the newest version is installed already. So adding the OCLP-Version Key to a Hackintosh build is not really a necessity.

> [!TIP]
> 
> If your system won't boot after patching it with OpenCore Legacy Patcher, you have several options to [revert root patches](/Guides/Reverting_Root_Patches.md).

## Notes
- Applying Root Patches to the system partition breaks its security seal. This affects System Updates: every time a System Update is available, the FULL Installer (about 12 GB) will be downloaded. There is a [**workaround**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/S_System_Updates/OTA_Updates.md) to this but it's only applicable to Haswell/Broadwell and newer.
- After each System Update, the iGPU/GPU drivers have to be re-installed. OCLP will take care of this. Just make sure to re-enable the appropriate boot-args to put AMD/NVIDIA GPUs in VESA mode prior to updating/upgrading macOS.
- ⚠️ You cannot install macOS Security Response Updates (RSR) on pre-Haswell systems. They will fail to install (more info [**here**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1019)).
